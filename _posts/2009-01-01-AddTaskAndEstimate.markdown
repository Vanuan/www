Find the User Story you will be estimating. At the start of an
iteration it should be in the Backlog (not yet assigned to an
iteration), or in the iteration you're working on.

Click on the link to show the story. Below the header "Subtasks"
you will find list of tasks and a "add" link. Click on that link.

You will be presented with a new screen. Add the following info:

-   Subject: a descriptive name of the task
-   Description: a summary of the task, what will be worked and
    needs, etc.
-   Estimated time: the total time in hours that you estimate will spend
    working on the task.
-   Remaining hours: if the task is new, it should be the same amount you
    entered in "Estimate".
-   Status: unless you are jumping straight to work on the task, you
    should leave it at its default value.
-   Assigned to (optiona): select a user from the dropdown list.

Click "Create". You're done.
