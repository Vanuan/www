This product is relatively new, and while I can appreciate why you
might want to fork code to your own repository (GitHub makes this very
easy), I would prefer it if patches were submitted upstream to this code base to help
avoid fragmenting the product into multiple unfinished projects. Of
course, the code is open source and you're free to fork it if you wish - however it'd be nice to have a central repository that is as
advanced and complete as possible.
