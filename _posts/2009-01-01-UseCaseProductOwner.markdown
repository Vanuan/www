You are the Product Owner for a team that has chosen to use
Redmine/Backlogs.

## Maintain the product backlog

After logging in to your project, click on the "Backlogs" menu tab. On
this screen you will see the current and future sprints on your left
(don't touch those), and the product backlog on the right (do touch
that). You can quickly change priorities by drag-and-dropping the
stories on the product backlog, or add a new story by clicking
(surprise) the "New story" link. Clicking on a story allows you to
change the title, but please don't change the sizes without talking to
your team, or better yet, leave that to your team entirely.

By clicking the number in the green square you will be taken the full
story details, where you can fill out background info on the story.

## How is my project doing?

Attending the standup is the easiest way to get a feel for your
project, but if you're not available at some point or you want to
share your project with the rest of the world, you can find the
burndown on the context menu of the active sprint. On the backlogs
screen you can also find the future sprints.

## Closing the sprint

You can  accept the sprint stories by closing them, and
then make sure you record your review/retro notes in the wiki. The
backlogs pane and the issues list will have convenience links that
will bring you to a wiki page linked to your sprint; it will be
created if it doesn't yet exist. If you want to bring some structure
into this, your system administrator can designate one of your wiki
pages to be the template page; if you have this set up, a copy of that
page will be used to initialize a sprint wiki page, but only if it
didn't exist when you requested it. Later changes to the template
won't affect existing pages.

## How am I doing?

If you click the "Home" link at the top-right of the page, you'll see
a tab called "Scrum Statistics". Here you will find information on
your projects, and how they're doing, scrum-wise. Only projects that
have the Backlogs module enabled (and that aren't archived) will show
up here.
