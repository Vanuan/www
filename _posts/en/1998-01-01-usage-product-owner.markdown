# Usage: Product Owner

As the product owner you are responsible for prioritizing and describing the stories in the product backlog. Read more about <a href="http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/scrum/product-owner" target="_blank">the product owner role</a> from Mountain Goat Software.

## Maintaining the product backlog

After logging in to your project, click on the "Backlogs" menu tab. This will take you to the _Master Backlog_ where you will see the current and future sprints on your left (don't touch those), and the product backlog on the right (do touch that).

You can quickly change priorities by dragging the stories in the product backlog, or add a new story by clicking (surprise!) the "New story" link. Clicking on a story allows you to change the title, but please don't change the story points without talking to your team, or better yet, leave that to your team entirely.

By clicking the number in the green square you will be taken the full story details, where you can add more details to it.

## How is my project doing?

Attending the standup is the easiest way to get a feel for your project, but if you're not available at some point or you want to share the project progress with the rest of the world, you can find the burndown on the context menu of the active sprint.

## Closing the sprint

You can accept the sprint stories by closing them, and then make sure you record your review/retro notes in the wiki. The backlogs pane and the issues list will have convenience links that will bring you to a wiki page linked to your sprint; it will be created if it doesn't yet exist. If you want to bring some structure into this, your system administrator can designate one of your wiki pages to be the template page. If you have this set up, a copy of that page will be used to initialize a sprint wiki page, but only if it didn't exist when you requested it. Later changes to the template won't affect existing pages.

## How am I doing?

If you click the _Back to Project Page_ and then click the _Home_ link at the top-left of the page, you'll see a tab called _Scrum Statistics_. Here you will find information on your projects, and how they're doing, scrum-wise. Only projects that have the Backlogs module enabled (and that aren't archived) will show up here.
