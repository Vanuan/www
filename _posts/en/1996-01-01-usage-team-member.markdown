# Usage: Team Member

You are part of a team that has chosen to use
Redmine/Backlogs.

If you're co-located, try to coerce your scrum master to work with
redmine on your behalf. Your role entails working on the product, not
administrative work if you can avoid it.

But if you are not co-located:

## Maintain the task board

You can edit time-remaining or the task status on the task board.
Editing time-remaining can be done by clicking the card and pressing
enter to confirm (or escape to cancel). To change the task status,
drag and drop it in the appropriate column.

If you need clarification for a story, _talk to your product owner_,
but do add those details to the story (click the story or task id, and
update the story or task).

You can add a task to a story by clicking the '+'.

But really, let
someone else do the boring administrative work. Pester your scrum
master to get that arranged.
