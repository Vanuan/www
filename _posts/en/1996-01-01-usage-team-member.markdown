# Usage: Team Member

As a team member, you are co-responsible for ensuring that the stories in the backlog are implemented in a manner that is acceptable to the product owner.


## Maintain the task board

![Sprint Taskboard](../../assets/images/sprint_taskboard.png)

The taskboard provides a number of functionalities you can use in your day to day work:

* **Add tasks** that you believe are needed to complete a story. You can do this by clicking the "+" button to the right of a story. Feel free to add as many tasks as needed. These will not be displayed in the master backlog.
* **Assign one or more tasks** to yourself. You can do this by clicking on a task and then selecting your name from the _Assigned To_ drop down. The task will immediately adopt your user color.
* If your team prefers to record the **time remaining** on each task, click on a task and input the remaining time accordingly. After you click _OK_, the value automatically displays as a red badge on the task.
* You can add **sprint impediments** by adding them at the top row marked _Sprint Impediments_.
* **Drag and drop** a task between columns to change its state.
* **Edit any attribute** of the task by clicking the task and modifying any of the fields.

> **NOTE:** Task colors are determined by the assignee's preferred color. This preference is randomly assigned by Backlogs if a user doesn't have a color yet. To modify your preferred color, go to your account page in Redmine.
