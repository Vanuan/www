h1. Roadmap

The following items are pretty certain to happen, in roughly this order:

h2. Version/story sharing between projects

This is currently in progress, but the complexity of the matter is enormously underestimated by the people clamoring for it. I've seen a few naive (sorry, but it's true) patches come in, which do show these shared versions/stories, but also introduce one or more of the following problems:

* Workflow breakage
* AJAX failures on the master backlogs page because it is no longer safe to assume any story can be dropped anywhere. Version sharing is pretty flexible *up and down* the tree, so the drag-and-drop stuff on the master page must adapt *dynamically* to only allow valid drop targets. This is currently implemented but I'm still working on tests for this. None of the other patches even considered this.
* AJAX failures on the taskboard because tasks can't assume they can be dropped on any story but their own, and impediments cannot be created for all combinations of tasks because a "blocks" relationship cannot transgress project lines. None of the other patches consider this. Not implemented yet.

h2. Proper "rejected" state for stories/tasks

Right a story in a "closed" state is considered to be "accepted" by the PO, and a task in a "closed" state is considered finished sucessfully. This has the problem that you're either keeping stories/tasks open indefinately (polluting your view of what remains to be done), or it will at some point screw subtly with your burndown. Proof of concept is done.

h2. Easy time logging

I'm going to add a desktop gadget to allow quick time logging

h2. Burndown calculation overhaul

h2. Allow any tracker as task

h2. Story state loosely follows task progress

h2. Sprints as objects separate from versions
