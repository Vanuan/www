h1. Roadmap

The following items are pretty certain to happen, in roughly this order:

h2. Version/story sharing between projects

This is currently in progress, but the complexity of the matter is enormously underestimated by the people clamoring for it. I've seen a few naive (sorry, but it's true) patches come in, which do show these shared versions/stories, but also introduce one or more of the following problems:

* Workflow breakage
* AJAX failures on the master backlogs page because it is no longer safe to assume any story can be dropped anywhere. Version sharing is pretty flexible *up and down* the tree, so the drag-and-drop stuff on the master page must adapt *dynamically* to only allow valid drop targets. This is currently implemented but I'm still working on tests for this. None of the other patches even considered this.
* AJAX failures on the taskboard because tasks can't assume they can be dropped on any story but their own, and impediments cannot be created for all combinations of tasks because a "blocks" relationship cannot transgress project lines. None of the other patches consider this. Not implemented yet.

h2. Easy time logging

I'm going to add a desktop gadget to allow quick time logging

h2. Allow any tracker as task

h2. Story state loosely follows task progress

h2. Sprints as objects separate from versions
