# Welcome!

Thanks for trying out Redmine Backlogs! We designed
this tool to do just enough for you to manage your projects in
an agile way. We use it on a daily basis and continually improve
on it. We hope you will find it useful too!

## About Redmine

## Redmine Backlogs Features

Redmine Backlogs is still a work in progress but can already do a
number of useful things for your agile team:

* Sort stories in your product and iteration backlogs
* Track story points for each of your stories
* Display burndown charts to show progress
* Track tasks via your iteration's taskboard
* Produce printable task board cards
* Track impediments within each iteration

And a lot more! 


## Getting Additional Help

Have a question that's not covered by this guide? Go ahead and
start a conversation in [the forums](http://backlogsplugin.morphexchange.com/). You may also follow
@redminebacklogs on *Twitter* for various announcements.


## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you find any bugs or maybe want to see some improvements to the
plugin, feel free to file a ticket in the project's [bug tracker](http://backlogsplugin.morphexchange.com/).
Better yet, go ahead and fork the project on github so you can fix the bugs
yourself, then send us a pull request so that we can incorporate it
into the main repo.


## Compatibility

We're building this tool during our free time only and, therefore, were only
able to test it in the following environments:

* Firefox 3.5.x Mac OS X
* Google Chrome 5.0.x Windows XP
* Redmine 1.0-stable
* PostgreSQL 8.2.6
* MySQL 5.0.83

but we'll happily fix it for other environments if you file an issue.
