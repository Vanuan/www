# Welcome!

Backlogs is a Redmine plugin that's designed to do just enough so your team can work in an agile way. It's still a work in progress, but we're already using it on a daily basis and continually improve on it. We hope you'll find it useful too!


## About Redmine

Redmine is, in one word, awesome. In a few more words, Redmine is an awesome web-based project management application. We're big fans, can you tell? It's written with the Ruby on Rails framework and released under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2 (GPL). Visit [the official website](http://www.redmine.org/) for more info.

## Redmine Backlogs Features

Redmine Backlogs is still a work in progress but can already do a number of useful things for your agile team:

* Sort stories in your product and iteration backlogs
* Track story points for each of your stories
* Display burndown charts to show progress
* Track tasks via your iteration's taskboard
* Produce printable task board cards
* Track impediments within each iteration

And a lot more! There are a few more things below that you should know before getting started, but if you can't wait, go ahead and [install the plugin now](../installation).

## Bugs and Feature Requests

If you find any bugs or maybe want to suggest improvements, feel free to file a ticket in the project's [bug tracker](https://github.com/relaxdiego/redmine_backlogs/issues). Better yet, go ahead and fork the project on github so you can fix the bugs yourself, then send us a pull request so that we can incorporate it into the main repo.
