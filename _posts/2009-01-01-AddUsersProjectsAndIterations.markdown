## Add Users

It is assumed you have already created user accounts for your project
team. You will need administrative access for this step.

The steps to add a user are the following, from the main admin
window:

-   Select your project
-   Click "Settings"
-   Click "Members"
-   Select the users you want to add and the roles you want to assign
    them
-   Click "Add"

### User Permissions

The roles your users have will determine what they can do. Relevant
permissions for Backlogs are:

-   Manage members: add, delete or lock users
-   Create project
-   Manage versions: versions are used for the sprints
-   Manage backlogs: you need this permission to do pretty much
    anthing in backlogs
-   The "Issue tracking" block

## Add Iteration(s)

To add an iteration, simply add a version to your project. Backlogs
will show only versions/sprints that have the status "open"

Then select the "Backlogs" tab for your project to add start-end dates
for your sprints, and to manage stories on your sprints.
